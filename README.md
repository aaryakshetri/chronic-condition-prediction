# Proactive Health Intelligence: Predicting Chronic Conditions via Lifestyle Patterns

This project provides a Jupyter notebook for Predicting Chronic Conditions from a Synthetic Health and Lifestyle Dataset available in Kaggle. It presents a deep dive in Classification analysis and demonstrates data cleaning, preprocessing, feature engineering and some common machine learning algorithms, alongside the frequently occuring issues during classification analysis such as class imblance, precision-recall trade off and finally suggests an appropriate model.
